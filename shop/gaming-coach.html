    <p>
      A gaming coach can help you achieve your goals, whether competitive or
      casual. Just as people invest in piano lessons and chess tutors, a gaming
      coach honing your skills brings immense value.
    </p>
    <p>
      With expertise in FPS games, I can coach many genres effectively. My
      coaching will benefit players of games like Valorant, COD: Warzone, CS:GO,
      Fortnite, Apex Legends, PUBG, and MW2 on PC or console.
    </p>
    <p>
      Through personalized coaching, you'll see major improvements in aim, game
      sense, movement, map knowledge, reflexes, and positioning. My deep
      technical grasp of FPS gameplay accelerates skill development.
    </p>
    <p>
      My affordable, negotiable rates make coaching accessible. If you or your
      kids want to enjoy games more by improving skills or even want to go 'pro' (E-Sports is a 1.39 billion dollar industry!), contact me to discuss
      tailoring a program:
